**This repo is supposed to be used as config by NvChad users!**

- The main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- So you just import its modules , like `require "nvchad.options" , require "nvchad.mappings"`
- So you can delete the .git from this repo ( when you clone it locally ) or fork it :)

# Branch 
merged (default)-> all configs for all OS merged using :'if nvim.fn.has("win32") ....'  
linux
windows

Difference between braches depends only on my personal workflows and setups, nothing 'technical'.
